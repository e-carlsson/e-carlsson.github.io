# About

My name is Emil Carlsson and I'm a PhD student in computer science at Chalmers University of Technology. I specialize in machine learning and decision-making under uncertainty, focusing on developing reliable data-driven decision-making systems. My primary research interest lies in reinforcement learning, a computational framework for decision-making under uncertainty. I am supervised by [Devdatt Dubhashi](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/dubhashi.aspx) and co-supervised by [Fredrik D. Johansson](https://www.fredjo.com).

For an updated list of my publications, see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VZhBQWQAAAAJ&hl=sv).
